\title{Ensemble of Small Models: Sampling background points using 4 different methods.}
\usage{
ESM_Bp.Sampling(
  env,
  n.points = 10000,
  method = "rand.geo",
  digit.val.env = 1,
  aggr.fact.geo = 5,
  n.strat.env = 3,
  To.plot = FALSE,
  xy.pres = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{env}{a \code{SpatRaster} of at least one layer. if \emph{method = "strat.geo"}, a minimum of 2 layers are needed.}

\item{n.points}{\code{integer}. The number of background to be selected. \emph{Note that this number can change depending on the technique}}

\item{method}{\code{character}. one of: "rand.geo", "strat.geo", "rand.env" or "strat.env". \emph{see Details}.}

\item{digit.val.env}{\code{integer}. The number of digit to keep to remove too similar environmental values.
Only needed when method = "rand.env". \emph{Default: 1}.}

\item{aggr.fact.geo}{\code{integer}. The aggregating factor to generate the checkerboard. Only needed 
when method = "strat.geo". \emph{see Details}. \emph{Default: 5}.}

\item{n.strat.env}{\code{integer}. The number of classes to create for each environmental layer. Only needed
when method = "strat.env". \emph{see Details}. \emph{Default: 3}.}

\item{To.plot}{\code{logical}. Should the background point plotted on a map (in black).}

\item{xy.pres}{A two-column \code{matrix} or \code{data.frame} containing the coordinates of the species occurrences.
Optional and only used when To.plot = TRUE. Plot the occurrences on the map (in aquamarine). \emph{Default: NULL}.}
}
\value{
a \code{matrix} containing the selected background points. The two first columns correspond to the coordinates.
The other columns correspond to the environmental values of these points and the last column correspond to the geographic 
or environmental classes (named "BigClass) to which the observation belongs (only for method = "strat.geo" or "strat.env")
}
\description{
This function generates background following the 4 different methods described by Steen et al (2024).
Two are generated in the environmental space whereas the remaining is in the geographic space (see details).
}
\details{
The "rand.geo" method corresponds to a random selection of background points in the geographic space. 
This is the most used techniques in SDM studies. This selection can also be stratified (method ="strat.geo"). To 
realise this stratification, a checkerboard is created with a pixel of a certain resolution. The size of these
pixels can be modified with the argument 'aggr.fact.geo'. For each pixel of the checkerboard the same number of 
background points are randomly selected to reach the value of \emph{n.points}. Selecting background points can also 
be performed in the environmental space (see Steen et al, 2024). The first method is the full random background
point selection (method = "rand.env"). To do so, a PCA is first performed and the two fist axes are kept to 
reflect the environmental space. Then, a grid of 100*100 pixel is created. To reduce too similar points, 
the PCA scores of each observation are rounded at a certain digit (argument digit.val.env) and only 
one observation among the similar ones is kept. Several points are then randomly selected in each pixel of this grid.
By doing this, the entire environmental is captured avoiding the over-abundance of some common environment. The
second method is the stratified selection of background point in the environmental spaces (method = "strat.env").
To perform this selection, each environmental layer is converted into classes of \emph{n.strat.env} (Default: 3)
by dividing the range of the environmental predictor by \emph{n.strat.env} of the same size. For each pixel 
constituting the grid, we then combined all the predictor together, creating a combination of classes. For each 
of the different possible combination of classes available, the same number of background point is selected  to 
reach the value of \emph{n.points}.
