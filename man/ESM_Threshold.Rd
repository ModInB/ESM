\title{Thresholds for Ensemble of Small Models}
\usage{
ESM_Threshold(ESM.ensembleMod)
}
\arguments{
\item{ESM.ensembleMod}{The object returned by \code{\link{ESM_Ensemble.Modeling}}.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with diverse threshold values.
}
\description{
This function evaluates the full model which is used for projections and provides thresholds to produce binary maps.
}
\details{
This function provides diverse thresholds which can be used to convert suitability 
maps into binary maps. Various thresholds are provided: TSS (where sensitivity and specificity are maximized) MCC (where the MCC is maximized), 
MPA 1.0 (where all presences are predicted positive), MPA 0.95 (where 95\% of all presences are predicted positive), MPA 0.90 (where 90\% of all 
presences are predicted positive), Boyce.th.min (the lowest suitability value where the predicted/expected ratio is >1) and Boyce.th.max (the highest
suitability value where the predicted/expected ratio is =1). 
For the use of this function, please refer to the manual of ESM_Modeling.
