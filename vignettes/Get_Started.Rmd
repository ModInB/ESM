## Loading the needed packages

```{r setup}
library(ESM)
library(terra)
```

## Case 1: Modeling with presence and absence data

### Data preparation

Here we first need to load our data. To realize an ESM, we first gather some information: the coordinates of the observations (called xy); a response vector (resp) attributing 1 if the species was present or 0 if absent; the name of the species (sp.name) and; environmental predictors (env), which can be a SpatRaster from terra package or a data.frame.

Let's focus here to model the distribution of *Tayloria serrata*, which were only found 15 times out of 413 plots, in the Western Swiss Alps. Here, we will use 5 predictors, obtained from the ecospat package and projected into the same CRS as our observations.

```{r}
## species information with environmental values
data("ESM_species.env") 
## SpatRaster with 5 environmental predictors
data("ESM_Env")

xy <- ESM_species.env[,1:2]
resp <- ESM_species.env[,3]
sp.name <- "Tayloria_serrata"
env  <- terra::unwrap(ESM_Env)
```

Plot of the observations across the study area

```{r}
terra::plot(terra::subset(env, 1), col = "grey85", 
            legend = FALSE, box = FALSE, axes = FALSE)
terra::points(xy[resp ==0,], pch = 13, col = "firebrick")
terra::points(xy[resp ==1,], pch = 16, col = "black")
```

With the package ESM, we can modify the parameters of each of the 5 modelling techniques available, with the function *ESM_Models.Options*. For this example, we will perform GLM with a binomial family, allowing linear and quadratic terms and performing a step AIC to select the best structure.

```{r}
mod.options <- ESM_Models.Options(GLM = list(type = "quadratic",
                                            test = "AIC")
                                 )
```

### Modeling Core

The first step to model species distribution is to use teh function *ESM_Modeling*, which will generate bivariate models, allowing by default all the possible pairs of predictors.

```{r}
my.ESM <- ESM_Modeling(resp = resp,
                       xy=xy,
                       env=env,
                       sp.name = sp.name,
                       models = c("GLM"),
                       models.options = mod.options,
                       prevalence = 0.5,
                       cv.method = "split-sampling",
                       cv.rep = 10,
                       cv.ratio = 0.7,
                       parallel = FALSE,
                       save.models = FALSE,
                       save.obj = FALSE,
                       verbose = FALSE)

my.ESM$biva.evaluations
```
